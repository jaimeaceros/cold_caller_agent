Agent notes:

1. Greeting state incomplete - add natural conversation to the greeting state before moving on to the rapport
2. Discovery state must be extended. Contextualize deeper on the products context if user asks.
3. there is no pushback after a small rejection -> evaluate add a pushback state in which sales techniques are applied
4. No truning back from wrapup state. add possible "change my mind" scenarios
